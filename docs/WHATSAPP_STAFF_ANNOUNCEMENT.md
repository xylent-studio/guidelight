Hey everyone — remember that budtender picks app I mentioned a little while back? It's done and ready to go.

It's called Guidelight. You can add your personal product recommendations, rate them, and write a quick note about why you love them. Customers see your picks organized by category — basically your own digital staff picks shelf.

If you want to get set up, talk to Justin R or catch me on shift and we'll send you an invite link. You click it, you're in — takes a couple minutes to set up your profile.

The app is at: guidelight.xylent.studio

Looking forward to seeing what everyone picks.

**Notes:**
- Justin R = Justin Rodriguez (Manager)
- Adjust "catch me on shift" based on your schedule
- The invite is a magic link sent to their email — they just click and they're logged in
