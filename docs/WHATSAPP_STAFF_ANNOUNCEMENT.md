Hey team! 👋

We just launched something new for SOM — it's called Guidelight.

It's a budtender picks app where you can share your personal product recommendations with customers. You add your favorite products, rate them, and write a quick note about why you love them. Customers can then see your picks organized by category.

Think of it like your own digital "staff picks" shelf.

To get set up, you'll need an invite. Talk to Justin R or catch me on shift and we'll send you a link. Once you click it, you're in — takes like 2 minutes to set up your profile.

The app lives at: guidelight.xylent.studio

Can't wait to see everyone's picks!

**Notes:**
- Justin R = Justin Rodriguez (Manager)
- Adjust "catch me on shift" based on your schedule
- The invite is a magic link sent to their email — they just click and they're logged in
