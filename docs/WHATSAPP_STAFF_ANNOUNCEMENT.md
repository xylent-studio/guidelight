Hey everyone — remember that budtender picks app I was telling you about? It's done. Like actually done. And I'm not gonna lie, I'm pretty damn proud of it.

It's called Guidelight. You add your personal product recs, rate them, write a quick note about why you love them — and customers can see your picks organized by category. Basically your own digital staff picks shelf.

I built this myself through my studio (Xylent Studios) and it honestly looks like a real product that came from an actual dev team. Go check it out:

guidelight.xylent.studio

If you want in, talk to Justin R or catch me on shift and we'll send you an invite. You click the link, you're in — takes like 2 minutes to set up your profile.

And for any of our resident nerds who want to peek under the hood, here's the full codebase:
github.com/xylent-studio/guidelight

Looking forward to seeing what everyone picks. Let's go.

**Notes:**
- Justin R = Justin Rodriguez (Manager)
- Adjust "catch me on shift" based on your schedule
- The invite is a magic link sent to their email — they just click and they're logged in
