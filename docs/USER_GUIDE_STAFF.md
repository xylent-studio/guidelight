# Guidelight Staff Guide

Welcome to Guidelight! This guide will help you set up your profile and start sharing your product picks with customers.

---

## Getting Started

### Your First Login

You'll receive an email invite from your manager with a link to Guidelight. Click that link and you're in — no password needed for the first login.

Once you're logged in, you can set a password if you want (Settings → Set Password), or just keep using the magic link from your email. Either way works.

**Tip:** Bookmark the app on your POS browser so it's always one click away.

## Setting Up Your Profile

Your profile is what customers see when they select you in Customer View. Take a few minutes to make it feel like *you*.

### Where to Find It

1. Log in to Guidelight
2. You'll land on **Staff View** — this is your home base
3. Your profile is at the top of the page

### What to Fill In

**My Vibe** — A short description of your style. What kind of budtender are you? Examples:
- "Chill and easygoing. I like helping newbies find their comfort zone."
- "Product nerd. Ask me about terps, I dare you."
- "Quick recommendations, no BS. In and out."

**Expertise** — What you're known for. Pick your strongest areas:
- "Sleep strains and nighttime edibles"
- "Budget picks that don't suck"
- "High-tolerance flower recommendations"

**Tolerance** — Give customers context on where you're coming from:
- "Light" — You're sensitive, so your picks work for beginners too
- "Moderate" — Average tolerance, relatable to most customers
- "Heavy" — You can handle the strong stuff

Don't overthink it. You can always update these later.

## Adding Your Picks

This is the fun part — sharing the products you actually love.

### How It Works

1. Scroll down past your profile to see **My Picks**
2. Click **+ Add Pick** in any category
3. Fill out the form:
   - **Product Name** — Exactly as it appears on the shelf
   - **Brand** — The brand name
   - **Category** — Flower, Pre-rolls, Vapes, Edibles, etc.
   - **Best For** — Day, Evening, Night, or Anytime
   - **Rating** — 1-5 stars (half-stars allowed!)
   - **Why I Love It** — Your personal take in 1-2 sentences

### Tips for Great Picks

- **Be specific.** "Good vibes" is vague. "Perfect for watching movies without passing out" is useful.
- **Be honest about ratings.** Not everything needs to be 5 stars. A 4-star pick with a great "why I love it" is more trustworthy.
- **Update regularly.** When you find a new favorite, add it! When something goes out of stock, deactivate it.

### Managing Your Picks

- **Edit** — Click the pencil icon on any pick to update it
- **Deactivate** — Toggle "Active" off to hide a pick without deleting it
- **Delete** — Remove picks you no longer want (click the trash icon)

## Using Customer View

Customer View is what you show customers on the POS screen. It displays your profile and picks in a clean, easy-to-browse layout.

### Switching to Customer View

1. Click **Customer View** in the top navigation
2. Your profile card will be selected by default
3. Flip the screen toward the customer and walk through your picks together

### Navigating Categories

Use the category tabs to jump between:
- Flower
- Pre-rolls
- Vapes
- Edibles
- Beverages
- Concentrates
- Wellness
- Topicals

Each tab shows your picks for that category with ratings and your "Why I Love It" notes.

### Showing Another Budtender's Picks

If a customer asks about a coworker's favorites, you can select their profile card at the top of Customer View to show their picks instead.

---

## Switching Themes

Guidelight supports light and dark modes to match your POS setup or personal preference.

### Where to Find the Theme Toggle

Scroll to the bottom of **Staff View** — you'll see three options:
- **Light** — Cream/white background, green accents
- **Dark** — Dark background, green highlights  
- **System** — Matches your device/browser preference

The theme persists across sessions, so set it once and forget it.
