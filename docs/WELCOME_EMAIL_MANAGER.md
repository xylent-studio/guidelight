Hey Justin,

I'm proud to share this with you — Guidelight is officially live and ready for State of Mind.

This is the budtender picks app we've been building. It gives your team a clean, professional way to share their personal product recommendations with customers. Think of it as giving every budtender their own digital "staff picks" shelf — organized by category, complete with ratings and personal notes.


GETTING STARTED
---------------

Step 1: Accept Your Invite

You'll receive an email shortly from Guidelight with the subject "You've been invited to Guidelight." Click the link in that email — it'll log you in automatically and set up your account. This is the same experience your staff will get when you invite them.

Check your spam folder if you don't see it within a few minutes.


Step 2: Bookmark the App

Once you're in, you can always access Guidelight at:
https://guidelight.xylent.studio/


WHAT YOU CAN DO AS MANAGER
--------------------------

You have full control over the app:

• Invite your team — Click "Invite Staff" from Staff Management. They'll receive a magic link email just like you did.

• Manage staff — Edit profiles, reset passwords, control who shows up to customers

• Review feedback — See bug reports and suggestions from your team

• Add your own picks — You can showcase your recommendations too

When you're ready to add budtenders, it's as simple as entering their email, name, and clicking send.

Looking forward to hearing what you think.
