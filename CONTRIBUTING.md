# Contributing – Guidelight
*Xylent Studios*

This project is intentionally small and focused, but we still treat it like a real product. These guidelines keep the codebase clean, consistent, and easy to grow.

---

## 1. Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/short-description
   ```

2. Make your changes.
3. Run the checks:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   ```

4. Commit with a clear message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add CustomerView layout"  # for example
   ```

5. Open a pull request and describe:
   - What you changed.
   - Why you changed it.
   - Any follow-up work needed.

For solo work, you can skip formal PRs, but still keep branches and commits clean.

---

## 2. Code Style

- Use **TypeScript** everywhere in `src/`.
- Prefer **functional React components** and hooks.
- Keep components focused and small; extract shared pieces to `components/shared/`.
- Name files and folders in a way that matches their domain (`BudtenderSelector`, `PickCard`, etc.).
- Use consistent formatting (Prettier or equivalent).

---

## 3. Data & Types

- Centralize Supabase types in a shared `types` module or re-use those generated by Supabase tooling if adopted.
- When adding fields to the database:
  - Update the SQL in the spec.
  - Update the TypeScript types.
  - Update forms and views that use the data.

Never silently change the schema without updating documentation.

---

## 4. UI / UX Principles

- **Clarity over cleverness.** The app is used mid-conversation on a live sales floor.
- Optimize for **scan-ability**:
  - Short, honest descriptions.
  - Clear labels.
- Keep interactive elements large enough for touch on POS screens.
- Avoid dark patterns or anything that over-sells a product.

---

## 5. Commits & Documentation

- Each commit should represent a logical change.
- Keep messages short but descriptive.
- If you add a major feature or change behavior:
  - Update `README.md` and/or `docs/GUIDELIGHT_SPEC.md`.
  - Note any TODOs or future ideas in a clear comment or issue.

---

## 6. Testing

Formal automated test coverage is optional for MVP, but:

- Manually test both Customer View and Staff View before merging changes.
- Test at least:
  - Adding a pick.
  - Editing a pick.
  - Deactivating a pick.
  - Viewing picks in Customer View for multiple budtenders.


## 6. AI Assistance (Cursor + MCP)

This project can be developed entirely with a normal editor, but it is often
worked on using **Cursor** with a small set of MCP tools. These tools are
optional but recommended for keeping the code aligned with reality.

**MCP tools we use:**

- **Postgres MCP**  
  Read-only access to the Supabase/Postgres *development* database. Use this
  when you are changing anything related to database schema or TypeScript
  types, or when you need to confirm actual table/column names and data types.

- **API / HTTP MCP**  
  Ability to call local dev endpoints or Supabase REST endpoints. Use this
  when you are verifying that API responses match our TypeScript interfaces, or
  when testing Guidelight backend behavior end-to-end.

These tools are configured per-developer inside Cursor (they are **not**
required to build or run the app). When available, prefer using them instead
of guessing schema or response shapes by hand.

## 7. Philosophy

Guidelight is a **real tool for real people**, not a toy demo.

- It should always be shippable and usable in the shop.
- It should feel honest, grounded, and respectful of customers and staff.
- It should be something Xylent Studios is proud to point to as “how we do things”.

If a change doesn’t support clarity, reliability, or honesty, reconsider it.
