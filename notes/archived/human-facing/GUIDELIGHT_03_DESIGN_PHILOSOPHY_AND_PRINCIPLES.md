# Guidelight & Xylent Studios – Design Philosophy (Human-Facing) – v8

This document explains how we want Guidelight to *feel* and behave as a product, so that everyone involved in building it (humans and AI) is aiming at the same target.

---

## 1. Who We Are (for this app)

Guidelight is built by **Xylent Studios** as an internal tool for a modern cannabis dispensary.

We are:

- **Practical** – We care about making the day smoother for staff.
- **Considerate** – We respect staff and customers with different levels of experience and comfort.
- **Professional but warm** – We avoid “stoner cartoon” clichés as well as sterile corporate speak.
- **Detail-oriented** – We care about consistency, wording, spacing, and correctness.

Guidelight should feel like:

> A calm, trustworthy helper that makes it easy to share what you genuinely recommend.

## 2. What We Want Guidelight To Be

### 2.1 For budtenders

- A **comfortable daily tool**, not a chore.
- A place where they can **see themselves**:
  - Their picks.
  - Their style of recommending.
- A tool that helps them:
  - Feel organized.
  - Feel proud of their board.
  - Start better conversations with customers.

### 2.2 For managers

- A **clear window** into how the team is using recommendations.
- A low-friction way to:
  - Onboard new staff.
  - Keep access clean and secure.
- Something they can show owners or regulators without embarrassment.

### 2.3 For customers

- A **reassuring backdrop**, not a distraction.
- A way to see that staff are thoughtful and intentional about what they recommend.
- A quick, legible way to compare options and remember names.

## 3. How We Want It To Feel

### 3.1 Emotional tone

We’re aiming for:

- Calm, grounded, intentional.
- Confident, not cocky.
- Friendly, not silly.

Guidelight does **not**:

- Yell at users or guilt them.
- Use sarcasm or inside jokes in core UI text.
- Use “stoner” stereotypes or immature humor.

### 3.2 Visual tone

- **Minimal and modern** – lots of breathing room.
- **Studio-grade** – feels like a purpose-built internal tool from a serious company.
- **Balanced** – some personality, but no wild color explosions in daily workflow.

Think: “responsible creativity” rather than “loud marketing site.”

## 4. Professionalism & Correctness

We expect the app to be:

- **Factually careful** – especially around lab data, product names, and categories.
- **Consistent in wording** – same concepts use the same labels everywhere.
- **Clean in behavior** – no half-working buttons, no confusing dead ends.

If something isn’t ready or fully implemented:

- We prefer to **hide it** or mark it clearly as “coming soon” rather than ship broken UX.

## 5. Target Audience Snapshot

- **Primary users:** budtenders in a legal dispensary.
  - Some are heavy tech users; some are not.
  - Many juggle multiple systems (Treez, Dispense, loyalty, etc.).
- **Secondary users:** managers and owners.
  - Care about reliability, professionalism, and how it looks if someone from outside sees it.
- **Indirect users:** customers in the store.
  - Might be first-timers, medical-focused, or very experienced.
  - Often overwhelmed or in a hurry.

Guidelight’s job is to **calm things down**, not add another noisy system.

## 6. UX Values to Keep in Mind

Whenever there’s a design or copy decision to make, we choose:

1. **Clarity over cleverness.**
2. **Fewer options over more options.**
3. **Real store workflows over imaginary features.**
4. **Consistency over novelty.**
5. **Graceful fallback over broken partial features.**

If a feature or text doesn’t make life clearly better for staff or managers, it probably doesn’t belong in the core product.
