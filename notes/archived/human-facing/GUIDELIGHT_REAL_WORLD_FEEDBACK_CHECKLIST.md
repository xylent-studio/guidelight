# GUIDELIGHT_REAL_WORLD_FEEDBACK_CHECKLIST

This is a simple checklist to use after Guidelight has been live on the floor for a bit. The goal is to collect real feedback without a big research project.

Use this with a few budtenders and at least one manager.

## 1. Budtenders

Ask each budtender:

1. **Usage**
   - Did you actually use Guidelight during your last few shifts?
   - What did you use it for? (Showing customers, checking your own picks, something else)

2. **My picks**
   - Is it clear what “My picks” is?
   - Was adding a new pick quick enough?
   - Did any part of the add/edit screen feel like “too much work”?

3. **Show to customer**
   - Did you use “Show to customer”?
   - If yes: did it feel safe and easy to go in and out of that view?
   - If no: what did you do instead when talking with customers?

4. **Content**
   - Are the products in your list still accurate for what you actually recommend today?
   - Is there anything that makes you *not* want to keep it up to date?

5. **Overall**
   - If we removed Guidelight tomorrow, would you miss it? Why or why not?

Take short notes in their own words.

## 2. Managers

Ask at least one manager:

1. **Team**
   - Are invites easy to send and track?
   - Have you had to reset passwords? Was it straightforward?

2. **Adoption**
   - How many staff are actually using their picks?
   - Does anyone seem confused by the interface?

3. **Store fit**
   - Does Display Mode or Show to customer fit with how you want the store to look and feel?
   - Is there anything you’d worry about if the owner or an inspector saw these screens?

## 3. Quick metrics to glance at (if available)

If there is any analytics or logging, check:

- Number of active users per week.
- How many times Show to customer is opened per day.
- Average number of picks per budtender.

These simple signals are enough to decide what to fix or improve next.
