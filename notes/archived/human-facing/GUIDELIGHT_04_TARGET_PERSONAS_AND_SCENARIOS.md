# Guidelight Target Personas & Scenarios – v8

This document captures a few simple personas and scenarios to help guide design decisions. These are not rigid, but they help us stay grounded in real people and situations.

### 1.3 “Sam” – The Curious Customer

- Experience: tried cannabis, but not an expert.
- Goals:
  - Find something that fits their current need (sleep, social, pain, etc.).
  - Feel safe and not overwhelmed.
- Pain points:
  - Too many similar-sounding products.
  - Jargon and lab numbers they don’t fully understand.
  - Fear of a bad or too-strong experience.

**What they want from Guidelight:**

- Clear, readable names and tags like “Sleep” or “Newbie-safe”.
- A sense that the budtender has curated this, not just reading a menu.
- Ability to remember the product name long enough to reach the counter.

## 2. Typical Scenarios

### 2.1 “Before My Shift” – Nate Setting Up

- Nate logs in on his phone before or at the start of his shift.
- He quickly adds a couple of new products he’s excited about.
- He removes one product that’s out of stock or no longer a top rec.
- This takes 2–5 minutes max.

### 2.2 “During a Busy Rush” – Quick Reference

- Nate is three people deep in line.
- A customer is at the counter, unsure between two categories.
- Nate opens My Board, taps Guest View, and uses a few key picks to:
  - Filter the conversation (“Are you looking more for sleep or social?”).
  - Point to one or two recommendations to try.

### 2.3 “New Hire” – Alicia Onboarding

- Alicia invites a new budtender by email.
- The new hire sets a password, logs in, and sees a friendly welcome.
- They add a couple of picks over their first week.
- Alicia can easily see who has or hasn’t set up a board.

### 2.4 “Storefront” – Display Mode as a Modern Chalkboard

- A monitor near the counter runs Display Mode.
- It shows one budtender’s board or a house board.
- Someone waiting in line notices a product name and asks about it when they reach the counter.
- The display helps spark conversations without creating more work.

## 3. How Personas Inform Design

- If a feature makes life harder for Nate or Alicia, it likely doesn’t belong in the core UI.
- If a wording choice confuses Sam, we should simplify it.
- We judge success of new features by asking:
  - “Would Nate actually use this on a busy shift?”
  - “Would Alicia be comfortable showing this screen to an owner?”
  - “Would Sam feel more or less overwhelmed looking at this?”
