# 14_GUIDELIGHT_METRICS_AND_SUCCESS_CRITERIA (FUTURE) – v8

This file sketches useful metrics to track once analytics are added. It is not part of MVP, but it informs design decisions now.

---

## 1. Adoption Metrics

- Number of active staff accounts.
- Number of staff with at least N picks on their board (e.g., 3+).
- Time from invite to first login.

## 2. Usage Metrics

- How often My Board is opened per day/shift.
- How often Guest View is opened.
- How often Display Mode is used and by which boards.

## 3. Content Metrics

- Average number of picks per board.
- Category distribution (Flower vs Edibles vs others).
- % of picks with lab info attached.

## 4. Quality Signals (Later)

- Staff editing rate:
  - How often picks are updated, not just created once and forgotten.
- Board churn:
  - How often picks are added/removed from boards.

## 5. Outcome Signals (Qualitative Initially)

- Manager and staff feedback on:
  - Whether Guidelight makes conversations easier.
  - Whether it helps new staff ramp faster.
  - Whether it feels trustworthy and professional in front of customers.

These metrics should guide future changes; if a new feature doesn’t improve or at least respect these signals, it should be reconsidered.
