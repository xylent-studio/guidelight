# 09_PHASED_ROADMAP_FOR_GUIDELIGHT_UI – v9

This roadmap is anchored in the simplified "My picks + Show to customer + Team" MVP.

---

## Phase 1 – Reality-First MVP (COMPLETE)

Deliver:

- My picks (staff home)
  - Simple list of picks.
  - Add/edit pick flow.
- Show to customer
  - Full-screen view of current user’s picks.
  - Category picker with All first.
- Team
  - Single screen for invites and basic account management.
- Display Mode (basic)
  - Full-screen picks view similar to Show to customer for POS/monitor.

No board editor, no drag-and-drop, no multiple named boards.

---

## Phase 2 – Visual & Interaction Enhancements

Possible additions once Phase 1 is stable and in use:

- Visual board styling on top of My picks / Show to customer.
- A “Signature pick” concept for highlighting top recommendations.
- Light layout variations (e.g., featured cards) in customer views.
- Configurable Display Mode defaults (e.g., default staff member, house list).

These must not change the core My picks mental model.

---

## Phase 3 – Boards, Analytics, and Advanced Lab Info

Longer-term:

- Multiple named boards per budtender (e.g., “Sleep”, “Budget”, “Newbie-friendly”).
- House board compositing picks from multiple staff.
- Basic analytics (how many staff use the app, how many picks per person, etc.).
- More structured lab data entry and visualizations.

Phase 3 should only begin after real-world usage confirms that Phase 1 is working and the core flows are stable.
